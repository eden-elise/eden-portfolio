      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Eden Tripp, I am a student at University of San Diego pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics with a concentration in Cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>I enjoy spending my nights playing my favorite video games, reading a good book, or watching youtube videos to learn something new.  
        I have found a love in building technical projects and solving some good math problems, always with a side of a questionable amount of tea.</p>
      <p>When I’m not learning or coding, you might find me hanging out with my sorority sisters, working on open-source projects, facetiming my family, reading about quantum mechanics or ciphers, or at my favorite kickboxing class. 
        I adore family dinners(especially when its sushi) whether they are with my immediate family or my family of friends at school! </p>
